# Mobile-location-tracker---Mini-Project
A simple and minimalistic app to allow one to send location to a device and allow or disallow live tracking.

Strong internet connection is needed for effective working of the application. 
You can only enable live location after you have added a location. 
Be patient, it is sometimes slow for added locations to appear on screen.
